Do ya really wanna
Do ya really wanna taste it?
Get it on (get on top)
Make a move extreme (make a pose)
Make a shortcut to your dreams
Float straight to the stars on that flying thing
getting snowblind
Game (set, go)
Pick a tune, chick harpoon in a world beyond
Get a beat, got a heat
On a phony string
Tear your world apart
Once the magic starts
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it?
What's going up must come down
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it?
Baby, you're losing ground
Blind to what you'll soon become
The mirror lies, the whole world's wrong but you
Dancing with blinkers on
Throw your dog the invisible bone
And put your jet in gear
Anything to get you out of here
Gotta go hit that ride
To the setting sun
I gotta leave this mess behind
Gotta cruise from the blues got a life to find
What you need's, there to read
On the dotted line
Kill your self-control
Welcome to the show
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it?
What's going up must come down
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it?
Baby, you're losing ground
Blind to what you'll soon become
The mirror lies, the whole world's wrong but you
Dancing with your blinkers on
Throw your dog the invisible bone
Poison to your mind
Devil in disguise
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it?
What's going up must come down
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it?
Baby, you're losing ground
Blind to what you'll soon become
The mirror lies, the whole world's wrong but you
Dancing with your blinkers on
Throw your dog the invisible bone
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it?
What's going up must come down
Do ya really wanna, do ya really wanna taste it?
Baby, you're losing ground
Blind to what you'll soon become
The mirror lies, the whole world's wrong but you
Dancing with your blinkers on
Throw your dog the invisible bone
